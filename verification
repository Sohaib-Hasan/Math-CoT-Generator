Question 1 

from sympy import *
april_sales = 48
may_sales = april_sales / 2
total_sales = april_sales + may_sales
assert total_sales == 72
print(f"Verification Success: {total_sales} clips.")
# output: Verification Success: 72.0 clips.

Question 2

from sympy import *
hourly_rate = 12
minutes_worked = 50
rate_per_minute = Rational(hourly_rate, 60)
total_earnings = minutes_worked * rate_per_minute
assert total_earnings == 10
print(f"Verification Success: ${float(total_earnings)}")
# output: Verification Success: $10.0
