Question 1: Natalia sold 48 clips in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May.  
How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?

Solution: 
The goal is to find the total number of clips sold in two months: April and May. 
Amount sold in April is already given as $48$. 
Amount sold in May is half of the April sales ($48 / 2$). 
Total sales = April Sales + May Sales. 

Calculate the number of clips sold in May: Natalia sold half as many as in April.
$$ \text{May Sales} = \frac{\text{April Sales}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 $$ 

Calculate total clips sold: Sum the sales from both months to find the total: 
$$ \text{Total Sales} = \text{April Sales} + \text{May Sales} $$ $$ \text{Total Sales} = 48 + 24 = 72 $$ 

Conclusion: Natalia sold a total of 72 clips altogether.

Question 2: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?

Solution:

Goal: Calculate total earnings for a 50-minute session.
Given rate: $$12$ per hour ($60$ minutes).
Strategy:
Convert the hourly rate to a per-minute rate.

Multiply the per-minute rate by the total minutes worked ($50$ minutes).

Determine the rate per minute: Since there are $60$ minutes in one hour: 
$$ \text{Rate per minute} = \frac{\text{Hourly Rate}}{60} = \frac{12}{60} = $0.20 \text{ per minute} $$

Calculate total earnings for 50 minutes: Multiply the per-minute rate by the time duration: 
$$ \text{Total Earnings} = 50 \times 0.20 = $10 $$

Conclusion: Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.

Question 3: Tina makes $18.00 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?

Solution:

Goal: Calculate total weekly earnings (5 days) including overtime.

Conditions:

Regular rate: $$18/hr$ for the first 8 hours/shift.
Overtime rate: $$18 + (0.5 \times 18) = $27/hr$ for hours exceeding 8 hours/shift.
Daily Workload: 10 hours total = 8 Regular hours + 2 Overtime hours.

Total Earnings = (Daily Regular Pay + Daily Overtime Pay) $\times$ 5 days.

Calculate Daily Regular Earnings: For the first 8 hours of the shift: 
$$ \text{Regular Daily Pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times $18/\text{hr} = $144 $$

Calculate Daily Overtime Rate and Earnings: The overtime rate is the regular wage plus half: 
$$ \text{Overtime Rate} = 18 + \left(\frac{1}{2} \times 18\right) = 18 + 9 = $27/\text{hr} $$ 
Since she works 10 hours total, she has $10 - 8 = 2$ overtime hours daily. 
$$ \text{Overtime Daily Pay} = 2 \text{ hours} \times $27/\text{hr} = $54 $$

Calculate Weekly Total: Total daily pay is $$144 + $54 = $198$. For 5 days: $$ \text{Total Weekly Pay} = $198 \times 5 = $990 $$

Conclusion: Tina makes a total of $990 for the 5-day work week.


Question 4: A bag has 3 red and 5 blue marbles. If I pick one, what is the probability it is NOT red?

Solution:

Goal: Calculate the probability of selecting a marble that is not red.

Givens: 3 Red marbles, 5 Blue marbles.

Logic: Total marbles = sum of all categories. Probability of "NOT Red" is the same as the probability of "Blue" in this two-color system.

Formula: $P(\text{NOT Red}) = \frac{\text{Number of Blue Marbles}}{\text{Total Marbles}}$.

Calculate total number of marbles (Sample Space): Summing the red and blue marbles gives the total size of the bag: 
$$ \text{Total} = 3 \text{ red} + 5 \text{ blue} = 8 \text{ marbles} $$

Identify marbles that are NOT red: According to the problem, the marbles that are not red are the blue ones: 
$$ \text{NOT Red Count} = 5 \text{ (blue marbles)} $$

Calculate the final probability: Divide the favorable outcomes by the total outcomes: $$ P(\text{NOT Red}) = \frac{5}{8} $$

Conclusion: The probability that the marble picked is not red is 5/8.

Question 5:
Janice can type $6$ sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. 
She typed for $20$ minutes, took a break, and typed $15$ minutes longer. She then had to erase $40$ sentences she had typed incorrectly. 
After a meeting, she typed for $18$ minutes more. In all, the paper had $536$ sentences by the end of today. 
How many sentences did she start with today?

Solution:

<think>
* Goal: Find sentences typed yesterday.
* Givens: Speed = 6 sent/min, Work sessions = 20+15+18 mins, Removed = 40, Total = 536.
* Strategy: Calculate today's net sentences, subtract from total.
* Formula: All sentences on paper - today's correct sentences 
</think>

We know that Janice total typing speed is $6$ sentences per minute

Step $1$: She worked $20$ minutes before break and write $20*6 = 120$ sentences. 
After the break she wrote for $15$ minutes = $15*6 = 90$ sentences. 

Step $2$: She removed $40$ incorrect sentences = $210-40=170$ sentences left  
Step $3$: She worked more and writes $18$ minutes more = $18*6=108$ sentences  
Step $4$: Her today's total progress on paper = $120+90-40+108=278$ sentences  
Step $5$: Total sentences on paper including yesterday and today = $536$  
Conclusion: She wrote $536-278=258$ sentences on paper yesterday


Question: There are some jelly beans in a jar. Three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. If $750$ jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are there in the jar?

Solution:

Goal: Find total number of jelly beans in the jar.
Givens: $\frac{3}{4}$ are red; $\frac{1}{4}$ of red are coconut flavored; Coconut count = $750$.
Strategy: 1. Find red count ($750 \times 4$); 2. Find total count (Red count $\div \frac{3}{4}$).

Calculate the total red jelly beans: Since coconut flavored beans are $\frac{1}{4}$ of red beans: 
$$ \text{Red Jelly Beans} = 750 \times 4 = 3,000 $$

Calculate the total jelly beans in the jar: Since red beans are $\frac{3}{4}$ of the total: 
$$ \text{Total Jelly Beans} = 3,000 \div \frac{3}{4} = 3,000 \times \frac{4}{3} = 4,000 $$

Conclusion: There are a total of 4,000 jelly beans in the jar.
