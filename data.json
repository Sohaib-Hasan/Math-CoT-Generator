    "question": "Tina makes 18 dollars an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is paid overtime at time and a half. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?",
    "cot": "Step 1: Tina is paid 18 dollars per hour for the first 8 hours each day, so her regular daily pay is 8 times 18, which equals 144 dollars. Step 2: She works 10 hours per day, so she has 2 hours of overtime each day. Step 3: Overtime is paid at time and a half, so the overtime rate is 18 plus half of 18, which equals 27 dollars per hour. Step 4: Her daily overtime pay is 2 times 27, which equals 54 dollars. Step 5: Her total daily pay is 144 plus 54, which equals 198 dollars. Step 6: Over 5 days, her total pay is 198 times 5, which equals 990 dollars.",

    "cot": "Step 1: In 20 minutes, Janice typed 20 × 6 = 120 sentences. Step 2: In 15 minutes, she typed 15 × 6 = 90 sentences. Step 3: She erased 40 sentences, so net so far is 120 + 90 − 40 = 170 sentences. Step 4: In the last 18 minutes, she typed 18 × 6 = 108 sentences. Step 5: Total sentences added today is 170 + 108 = 278 sentences. Step 6: She started today with 536 − 278 = 258 sentences.",
