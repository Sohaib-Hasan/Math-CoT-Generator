Question 1: Natalia sold 48 clips in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?

Solution: We have to find the total number of clips sold in April and May.

Step 1: Natalia sold \(48\) clips in April.

Step 2: In May, she sold half as many clips as in April.

\[\text{May sales}=\frac{48}{2}=24\]

Step 3: Total sales

\[\text{Total clips} = 48 + 24 = 72\]

Final Answer: Natalia sold \(72\) clips altogether.
