Question 1: Natalia sold 48 clips in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May.  
How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?

Solution: 
The goal is to find the total number of clips sold in two months: April and May. 
Amount sold in April is already given as $48$. 
Amount sold in May is half of the April sales ($48 / 2$). 
Total sales = April Sales + May Sales. 

Calculate the number of clips sold in May: Natalia sold half as many as in April.
$$ \text{May Sales} = \frac{\text{April Sales}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 $$ 

Calculate total clips sold: Sum the sales from both months to find the total: 
$$ \text{Total Sales} = \text{April Sales} + \text{May Sales} $$ $$ \text{Total Sales} = 48 + 24 = 72 $$ 

Conclusion: Natalia sold a total of 72 clips altogether.

Question 2: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?

Solution:

Goal: Calculate total earnings for a 50-minute session.
Given rate: $$12$ per hour ($60$ minutes).
Strategy:
Convert the hourly rate to a per-minute rate.

Multiply the per-minute rate by the total minutes worked ($50$ minutes).

Determine the rate per minute: Since there are $60$ minutes in one hour: 
$$ \text{Rate per minute} = \frac{\text{Hourly Rate}}{60} = \frac{12}{60} = $0.20 \text{ per minute} $$

Calculate total earnings for 50 minutes: Multiply the per-minute rate by the time duration: 
$$ \text{Total Earnings} = 50 \times 0.20 = $10 $$

Conclusion: Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.

Question 3: Tina makes $18.00 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?

Solution:

Goal: Calculate total weekly earnings (5 days) including overtime.

Conditions:

Regular rate: $$18/hr$ for the first 8 hours/shift.
Overtime rate: $$18 + (0.5 \times 18) = $27/hr$ for hours exceeding 8 hours/shift.
Daily Workload: 10 hours total = 8 Regular hours + 2 Overtime hours.

Total Earnings = (Daily Regular Pay + Daily Overtime Pay) $\times$ 5 days.

Calculate Daily Regular Earnings: For the first 8 hours of the shift: 
$$ \text{Regular Daily Pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times $18/\text{hr} = $144 $$

Calculate Daily Overtime Rate and Earnings: The overtime rate is the regular wage plus half: 
$$ \text{Overtime Rate} = 18 + \left(\frac{1}{2} \times 18\right) = 18 + 9 = $27/\text{hr} $$ 
Since she works 10 hours total, she has $10 - 8 = 2$ overtime hours daily. 
$$ \text{Overtime Daily Pay} = 2 \text{ hours} \times $27/\text{hr} = $54 $$

Calculate Weekly Total: Total daily pay is $$144 + $54 = $198$. For 5 days: $$ \text{Total Weekly Pay} = $198 \times 5 = $990 $$

Conclusion: Tina makes a total of $990 for the 5-day work week.
