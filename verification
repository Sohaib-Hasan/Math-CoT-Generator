Question 1 

from sympy import *
april_sales = 48
may_sales = april_sales / 2
total_sales = april_sales + may_sales
assert total_sales == 72
print(f"Verification Success: {total_sales} clips.")
# output: Verification Success: 72.0 clips.

Question 2

from sympy import *
hourly_rate = 12
minutes_worked = 50
rate_per_minute = Rational(hourly_rate, 60)
total_earnings = minutes_worked * rate_per_minute
assert total_earnings == 10
print(f"Verification Success: ${float(total_earnings)}")
# output: Verification Success: $10.0

Question 3

from sympy import *
days = 5
regular_hours_limit = 8
total_daily_hours = 10
base_rate = 18
overtime_rate = base_rate + Rational(base_rate, 2)
overtime_hours = total_daily_hours - regular_hours_limit

weekly_regular = days * regular_hours_limit * base_rate
weekly_overtime = days * overtime_hours * overtime_rate
grand_total = weekly_regular + weekly_overtime

assert grand_total == 990
print(f"Verification Success: Total weekly pay is ${grand_total}")
# output: Verification Success: Total weekly pay is $990

Question 4

from sympy import *

red = 3
blue = 5
total = red + blue

prob_not_red = Rational(blue, total)

assert prob_not_red == Rational(5, 8)
print(f"Verification Success: {prob_not_red}")
#output: Verification Success: 5/8

Question 5

from sympy import *
speed = Integer(6)
t1 = 20
t2 = 15
t3 = 18
removed = 40
total = 536

s1 = speed * t1
s2 = speed * t2
s3 = speed * t3

today_total = s1 + s2 - removed + s3
yesterday = total - today_total
assert yesterday == 258
print(f"Verification Success: {yesterday} sentences yesterday.")
#output: Verification Success: 258 sentences yesterday.
